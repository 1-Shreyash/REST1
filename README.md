# REST1
  Build my first Api with REST and deployed it successfully on Railway app.

## Try the following Queries : 

1) sort :
   
   https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?sort=company
  
   https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?sort=name
  
   https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?sort=price

  
3) select :
   
   https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?select=name

   
5) pages : (default pagination : limit -> 5)
   
   https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?page=2&limit=6
