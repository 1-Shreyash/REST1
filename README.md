# REST1
  Build my first Api with REST and deployed it successfully in Railway app.

## Try the following Queries : 
1) sort :
  https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?sort=company
  https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?sort=name
  https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?sort=price
2) select :
   https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?select=name
3) pages : (default pagination : limit -> 5)
   https://rest1-production-c512.up.railway.app/api/products?page=2&limit=6
